# CreativeListView
I found the list view design on dribbble.com and I make it to practice android skill (java).

Here some thing I do in this project:
1. Create recyclerview, card item.
2. Nested thumbnail recyclerview in list item (recyclerview).
3. Apply font for text (Indie Flower).
4. Load thumbnails with glide.
